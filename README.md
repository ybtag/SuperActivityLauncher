Activity Launcher
=================

Create shortcuts for any installed app and even hidden activities to launch them with ease.

This branch uses the BadParcel vulnerability (CVE-2023-20963) to launch all activities, even private ones or ones which require special permissions.

Note that this only works on devices which have not been patched for CVE-2023-20963
